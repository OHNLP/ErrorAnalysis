### Definitions and examples

**<a id="annotation-error">ðŸ“‚ 1. Annotation Error</a>**

_Definition:_ Human error occurred during corpus annotation, which is a process involving the manual review, judgment, marking, and labeling of linguistic and clinical concepts from unstructured text.

- ðŸ“„ **<a id="missing-annotation">1.1. Missing annotation</a>**

  _Definition:_ Annotators fail to capture concepts due to human errors.

  _Example (delirium):_

  - Confusion/Disorientation Hendrich: Yes
  - Best Verbal Response Glasgow: Confused

- ðŸ“„ **<a id="guideline-error">1.2. Guideline error</a>**

  _Definition:_ Errors occur due to conflicts between the NLP definition and the annotation guideline definition. For example, the version of the guideline does not align with the NLP version.

  _Example (delirium):_

  - Guideline definition: encephalopathy = delirium positive
  - NLP definition: encephalopathy = CAM_D

- ðŸ“„ **<a id="misclassification">1.3. Misclassification</a>**

  _Definition:_ Annotators captured incorrect concepts due to human errors.

  _Example (delirium):_

  - Screening for delirium = delirium (positive)
    -> Incorrect, screening for delirium should be marked as delirium (exclusion)

**<a id="contextual-error">ðŸ“‚ 2. Contextual Error</a>**

_Definition:_ Information found in the context of the condition that modifies individual clinical conditions.

- ðŸ“„ **<a id="absence-of-context">2.1. Absence of context</a>**

  _Definition:_ NLP model falsely or partially captures concepts due to a lack of enough context to determine the certainty, status, and subject of the expression.

  _Example (delirium):_

  - â€˜Confusionâ€™ (occurs as a single concept without context)
    _Correction:_
  - Patient has a constant confused look displayed on his/her face.

- ðŸ“„ **<a id="certainty">2.2. Certainty</a>**

  _Definition:_ NLP model falsely captures concepts due to incorrectly judging grade (within the power or capacity of someone or something), possible, probable-related terms or expressions.

  - ðŸ”¸ **<a id="differential-diagnosis">2.2.1. Differential diagnosis</a>**

    _Definition:_ Description that documents a process where clinicians consider various possible conditions or diseases that could explain a patient's symptoms before making a final diagnosis.

- ðŸ“„ **<a id="normalization-error">5.3. Normalization error</a>**

  _Definition:_ An error occurred while mapping medical mentions to standardized ontologies like UMLS or controlled vocabularies like SNOMED CT.

  _Example:_

  - In UMLS, some medications' descriptions contain strength information, including "cyanocobalamin 1000 MCG Oral Tablet" (CUI: C0976004), "cyanocobalamin 1000 MCG Oral Capsule" (CUI: C0786262), etc. Based on the example: "2. Cyanocobalamin 1000 mcg/mL Solution Sig: One (1) Injection DAILY (Daily) for 3 days," the system matched "Cyanocobalamin 1000" to CUI-C0976004 as a medication and ignored "1000 mcg/ml" as a strength.
